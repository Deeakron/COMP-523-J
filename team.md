Team Rules:

Team Behavior:
* For missing a meeting, 24 hours advance notice is expected, with emergencies getting a pass.
* For frequency of communication, outside of meetings it will be as needed, but we will have an extra meeting on Mondays.
* For method of communication, Discord will be used for meetings, while Discord/GroupMe will be used for communication outside of meetings.
* For delays, less than a day at most of delay is expected.
* If there is no response, then you are expected to make a command decision and note the lack of response for later.

Coding Style:
to be determined later
