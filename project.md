### Project Summary

Our project is to create a website for judges from a Venture Capital competition to submit results and have the results be viewed online.


### Project Description

The project is upgrading a results and submission system for the Venture Capital competition run by Patrick Vernon to a more functional website. The website will be a better site for judges to submit their results and for the organizers to put together competitions, as well as for participants to view the results. In addition to being a website viewable on mobile and desktop, a desktop app is also planned.
