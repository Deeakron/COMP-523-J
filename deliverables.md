### User Stories

Need to have:
* As an Administrator, in order to create events, I can create a Google Sheet with the Judge / Participant data.
* As a Judge, in order to know which event I'm in, I can click an event and see my name listed.
* As a Judge, in order to vote in an event, I can click on the event, then my name, then fill out the form.

Nice to have:
* As an Organizer, in order to give the students the results, I can view the real-time results page.
* As a Viewer, in order to view the final results, I can navigate to the results page if given permission by the organizer.
* As a Judge, in order to correct the spelling of my name, I can type in the new spelling of my name.

### Apples Reflection 1

In working with the UNC Kenan-Flager Business School on the Venture Capital Investment Competition (VCIC), we are able to support entrepreneurial education across the country. VCIC is a national series of competitions that has real entrepreneurs pitching ideas to students as though they were investors. This flipped competition provides experience for both the entrepreneurs and students, giving them new and valuable perspectives in the world of business. In seeing how entrepreneurs pitch their ideas, students will be able to better express their own if they are ever looking for investments. Because VCIC is a competition strictly created for educational purposes, it is an effective way to teach students about financing new ventures.<br/>
Our contribution to VCIC creates a simpler interface for judges to submit their votes for winning participants. This increase in usability makes it easier to find and retain judges for every year the event continues. Because the interface is easy to use, judges will see it as less of a chore and more of an opportunity to give their time and energy to contribute in this educational venture. As judges are hard to find and keep, VCIC will have a chance to grow â€“ including more competitions and students to participate in them. By giving more people the opportunity to participate in this competition, we assist them in learning the principles of business and finance.
